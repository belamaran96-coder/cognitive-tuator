1. Project Overview

Project Name

Cognitive Tutor: One-Document → Mastery

Theme

Theme 2: Reasoning and Personalized Experience (Maximized Context)

Problem Statement

Most AI learning tools rely on:

Shallow summarization

Repeated document reprocessing

Multi-turn conversations that waste tokens


As a result, they fail to measure true understanding, personalize learning, and scale efficiently.

Our Solution

Cognitive Tutor transforms any large document into a personalized learning experience using:

A single deep reasoning pass over the document

Complex, rubric-backed questions

Single-turn evaluation with personalized feedback


This enables deep comprehension, not just surface-level Q&A.

2. Key Innovation

What Makes This Project Unique

✔ Reasoning-first, not chatbot-based
✔ Document analyzed once only
✔ Hidden evaluation rubrics for accuracy
✔ Personalized feedback without repeated context
✔ Optimized Gemini API usage

> “We teach understanding, not answers.”

4. Functional Workflow

Step 1: Document Upload

User uploads a PDF or large text file

Text is extracted using a PDF parser

Entire document sent once to Gemini



---

Step 2: Deep Document Intelligence (Single Call)

Gemini performs:

Core theme extraction

Implicit assumption detection

Cross-section reasoning

Difficulty mapping


Output stored locally for reuse.


---

Step 3: Question Generation

Gemini generates:

Exactly 5 complex questions

Each question tests:

Synthesis

Evaluation

Application


Each question includes a hidden rubric



---

Step 4: Learner Interaction

User selects a question

Submits a free-text answer



---

Step 5: Single-Turn Evaluation

One Gemini call evaluates:

Conceptual accuracy

Depth of reasoning

Missed ideas

Personalized improvement suggestion


⚠ No follow-up questions
⚠ No document re-analysis
